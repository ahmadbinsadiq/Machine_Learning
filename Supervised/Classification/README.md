# Classification in Machine Learning

This folder contains various types of classification analyses used in machine learning. Classification is a fundamental technique used to categorize data points into distinct classes based on one or more independent (predictor) variables. Below is a table outlining when to use each type of classification algorithm.

## Types of Classification and Their Use Cases

| Classification Type            | When to Use                                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Logistic Regression**        | When you have binary or multinomial classification problems and want to model the probability of class membership. |
| **Decision Trees**             | When you need an interpretable model that can handle both numerical and categorical data with clear decision rules. |
| **Random Forest**              | When you need a robust, ensemble method that improves accuracy and reduces overfitting by combining multiple decision trees. |
| **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** | When you need a powerful classifier for both linear and non-linear decision boundaries, especially in high-dimensional spaces. |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  | When you have a simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies based on the majority class of the nearest neighbors. |
| **Naive Bayes**                | When you need a probabilistic classifier that assumes feature independence and is effective for large datasets with categorical features. |
