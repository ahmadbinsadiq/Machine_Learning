# Supervised Learning Algorithms Repository

## Overview
This repository aims to include a comprehensive collection of supervised learning algorithms and their subcategories. The goal is to provide a wide range of implementations to demonstrate various techniques in regression and classification. Each algorithm is implemented in Python and comes with detailed documentation and example usage.

## Algorithms Included
1. **Regression**
   - Linear Regression
   - Ridge Regression
   - Lasso Regression
   - Polynomial Regression

2. **Classification**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Naive Bayes

## Dataset
The algorithms are demonstrated using various datasets sourced from reliable sources like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, and other publicly available datasets. Each dataset is preprocessed as necessary for the corresponding algorithm.
