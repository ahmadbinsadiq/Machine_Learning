# Case Studies

## Overview

This folder contains a series of case studies focused on fine-tuning machine learning models and identifying the best models for specific datasets. Each case study includes detailed steps from data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and final model evaluation. The goal is to provide practical examples of how to approach different machine learning problems and achieve optimal performance.
