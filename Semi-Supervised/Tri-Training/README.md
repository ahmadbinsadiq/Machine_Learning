# Tri-Training in Semi-Supervised Learning
## Overview

This repository contains implementations of Tri-Training algorithms used in semi-supervised learning. Tri-Training is an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning technique that leverages three classifiers trained on different subsets of features or views of the data. These classifiers collaborate by generating pseudo-labeled data for each other to improve classification accuracy. Below is a summary of the Tri-Training algorithm and its primary use case.

## Tri-Training Algorithm and Its Use Case
