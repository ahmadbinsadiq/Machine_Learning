# Co-Training in Semi-Supervised Learning
## Overview

This folder contains various implementations of co-training algorithms used in semi-supervised learning. Co-training involves training multiple classifiers on different subsets of features or views of the data. The classifiers collaborate by exchanging confidently predicted labels for unlabeled data instances between each other. Below is a summary of the co-training algorithm and its primary use case.

## Co-Training Algorithm and Its Use Case
