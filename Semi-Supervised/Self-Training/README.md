# Self-Training in Semi-Supervised Learning

## Overview
This folder contains various implementations of self-training algorithms used in semi-supervised learning. Self-training is a simple and effective method for leveraging unlabeled data by iteratively training a classifier and using it to label the unlabeled data. Below is a table outlining the main self-training algorithm and its use case.

## Self-Training Algorithm and Its Use Case

| Algorithm         | When to Use                                                                 |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Self-Training     | When you have a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data, and you want to iteratively improve your classifier by using its own predictions to label the unlabeled data. |

## Contents
