# Semi-Supervised Learning Algorithms Repository

## Overview
This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of semi-supervised learning algorithms and their implementations. The goal is to demonstrate various techniques in semi-supervised learning, combining both labeled and unlabeled data to improve model performance. Each algorithm is implemented in Python and comes with detailed documentation and example usage.

## Algorithms Included

### Self-Training
- Self-Training Classifier

### Generative Methods
- Semi-Supervised Generative Adversarial Networks (SGAN)
- Variational Autoencoders (VAE)

### Graph-Based Methods
- Label Propagation
- Label Spreading

### Co-Training
- Co-Training with different feature sets

### Ensemble Methods
- Tri-Training
- Democratic Co-Learning

## Dataset
The algorithms are demonstrated using various datasets sourced from reliable sources like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, and other publicly available datasets. Each dataset is preprocessed as necessary for the corresponding algorithm.
