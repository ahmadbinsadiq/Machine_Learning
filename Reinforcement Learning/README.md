# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms Repository

## Overview
This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of reinforcement learning algorithms and their implementations. The goal is to demonstrate various techniques in reinforcement learning, ranging from simple to advanced algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented in Python and comes with detailed documentation and example usage.

## Algorithms Included

### Model-Based Methods
- Model-Based RL
- Dyna-Q

## Dataset
The algorithms are demonstrated using various datasets sourced from reliable sources like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, and other publicly available datasets. Each dataset is preprocessed as necessary for the corresponding algorithm.

- **model_based/**: Implementation scripts for model-based methods.
  - **mdoel_based_rl**: Implementation of model_based_rl with example usage
  - **dyna_q.ipynb**: Implementation of Dyna-Q with example usage.
- **README.md**: Detailed information about the repository, installation instructions, usage examples, and more.

## Usage
To use any of the algorithms, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ahmadbinsadiq/Machine_Learning_Models-and-Case-Studies.git
