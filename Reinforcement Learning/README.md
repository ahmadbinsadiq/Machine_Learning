# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms Repository

## Overview
This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of reinforcement learning algorithms and their implementations. The goal is to demonstrate various techniques in reinforcement learning, ranging from simple to advanced algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented in Python and comes with detailed documentation and example usage.

## Algorithms Included

### Value-Based Methods
- Q-Learning
- SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)
- Deep Q-Network (DQN)

### Policy-Based Methods
- REINFORCE Algorithm
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- Actor-Critic Methods

### Model-Based Methods
- Dyna-Q
- Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

## Dataset
The algorithms are demonstrated using various environments from OpenAI Gym, including but not limited to:
- CartPole
- MountainCar
- Acrobot
- Atari Games

Each environment is chosen to illustrate the capabilities and applications of the respective reinforcement learning algorithms.
