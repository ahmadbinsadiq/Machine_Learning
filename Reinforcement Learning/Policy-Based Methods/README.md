# Policy-Based Methods in Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This repository focuses on various policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms and examples. Policy-based methods directly parameterize the policy of the agent and optimize it to maximize cumulative rewards. The goal is to provide a comprehensive collection of these algorithms with detailed documentation and example usage.

## Types of Policy-Based Methods and Their Use Cases

| Technique                      | When to Use                                                                               |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| REINFORCE Algorithm            | When you want to optimize a policy by directly adjusting its parameters based on performance feedback. |
| Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) | When you need a stable policy gradient method that balances exploration and exploitation effectively. |
