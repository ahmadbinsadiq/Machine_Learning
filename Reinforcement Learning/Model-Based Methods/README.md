# Model-Based Methods in Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This repository focuses on various model-based reinforcement learning algorithms and examples. Model-based methods involve constructing or learning a model of the environment and using it to make decisions. The goal is to provide a comprehensive collection of these algorithms with detailed documentation and example usage.

## Types of Model-Based Methods and Their Use Cases

| Technique           | When to Use                                                                                              |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Model-Based RL      | When you have a well-defined model of the environment dynamics and want to plan based on this model.     |
| Dyna-Q              | When combining model-based planning with Q-Learning to improve efficiency in learning optimal policies.  |

## Contents
