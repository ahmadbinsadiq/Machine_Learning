# Value-Based Methods in Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This repository contains various value-based reinforcement learning algorithms and examples. Value-based methods focus on learning the value of actions or states and using these values to make decisions. The goal is to provide a comprehensive collection of these algorithms with detailed documentation and example usage.

## Types of Value-Based Methods and Their Use Cases

| Technique         | When to Use                                                                                                                                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Q-Learning        | When you want an off-policy algorithm that can find the optimal action-selection policy by learning the Q-values for each state-action pair.              |
| SARSA             | When you need an on-policy algorithm that updates the Q-values based on the action actually taken by the agent.                                          |
