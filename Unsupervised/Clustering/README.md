# Unsupervised Clustering in Machine Learning

This folder contains various types of clustering analyses used in machine learning. Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points into clusters based on their inherent similarities. Below is a table outlining when to use each type of clustering algorithm.

## Types of Clustering and Their Use Cases

| Clustering Type      | When to Use                                                                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| K-Means              | When you have a large dataset and need a simple, efficient algorithm to partition data into K clusters. |
| Hierarchical         | When you need a dendrogram to understand the hierarchical relationship between clusters.       |
| DBSCAN               | When you have data with noise and need a method that can find clusters of varying shapes.     |
| Gaussian Mixture     | When you assume that data points are generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions.|
