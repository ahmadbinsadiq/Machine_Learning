# Dimensionality Reduction in Machine Learning

This folder contains various types of dimensionality reduction techniques used in machine learning. Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of features or dimensions in a dataset while preserving as much information as possible. Below is a table outlining when to use each type of dimensionality reduction algorithm.

## Types of Dimensionality Reduction and Their Use Cases

| **Reduction Type**        | **When to Use**                                                                                                                                         |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** | When you need to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the variance. Ideal for linear dimensionality reduction.                                      |
| **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)** | When you need to visualize high-dimensional data in a low-dimensional space, especially for clustering or classification tasks.                               |
| **Autoencoders**           | When you need a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique, especially useful for image and text data. Implemented using neural networks.        |
| **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)** | When you want to separate mixed signals or identify underlying hidden factors contributing to observed data variability.|
