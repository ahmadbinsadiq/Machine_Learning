# Anomaly Detection Techniques in Machine Learning

This folder contains various techniques and examples for anomaly detection in machine learning. Anomaly detection is a critical task aimed at identifying patterns in data that do not conform to expected behavior. Below is a table outlining the use cases for each anomaly detection algorithm.

## Types of Anomaly Detection Techniques and Their Use Cases

| Technique                | When to Use                                                                                       |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Isolation Forest         | When anomalies are isolated instances in the data, and you want to detect outliers efficiently.    |
| Local Outlier Factor (LOF)| When anomalies are local deviations from the surrounding data points, useful for clustered data.   |
| One-Class SVM            | When you have a dataset with only normal data and want to detect anomalies as outliers.            |
